            Arsenal Football Club <br>
            North Londons Finest <br>
            I have loved this club since I first got into football in year 6. I picked them because
            they were the team my Mum says she supported (even though she didn't like football!).
            My first memory of supporting this club came a few years after I started supporting the club.
            It was the 2005 FA cup final vs Manchest United. I remember we won the game on penalties and I was
            ecstatic. Since then I have been a massive Gooner and followed them avidly since.

              The New York Football Giants<br>
              Ohhhh the bane of my existence sometimes. I first started following the Giants when
              I started to play American Football at my short stint in University. I sorted of liked
              using the Eagles on Madden when I played as a teenager, however I felt no affinity for them.
              In fact, the thing that got me into them, was actually the defensive end who was playing for
              them at that time. Jason Pierre-Paul. He played in my position and I absolutely idolised that man.
              The year that I started following them, they actually went on to win the Super Bowl... And that was
              the last glory I was of this team. Been a struggle since, but I picked them, and I can't change that!

              The Los Angeles Lakers <br>
              One man made me fall in love with this team. Kobe Bryant (RIP).<br>
              To this day, everytime I make a free throw to throw something in the bin, I call the mans name because...
              That's just the done thing! Black Mamba was the man at hitting the buckets from far out. Wasn't the same
              after he left. Although we do have some top guys now, and we won the Championship in the bubble with the
              GOAT Lebron leading the way. The team with him, big AD Anthony Davis and the loveable Austin Reaves, they're
              still a pleasure to watch to this day!
